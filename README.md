# FullStack App with NuxtJS, NestJS and DataStax

Building a fullstack app is hard, but it does not have to be difficult. We will build the frontend and a backend that connects to a real database using NuxtJS (vuejs), NestJS (expressjs) and DataStax NoSQL serverless db. 

I will do another video soon using NextJS which is a ReactJS framework. Any other tools you would like me to try? Maybe Angular, Svelte or Ionic ...?

- DataStax's AstraDB NoSQL serverless (free) http://links.eddiejaoude.io/t/Q1cmdCP...
- NuxtJS a framework for VueJS a frontend library http://nuxtjs.org
- NestJS a framework for ExpressJS to create RESTful APIs http://nestjs.com

This project was built for a YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbUpYeLn6SI&lc=Ugx2B9M8KvUKrmNJi0l4AaABAg
